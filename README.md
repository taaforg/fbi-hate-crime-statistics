# FBI Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program Hate Crime Statistics Data #

The [Hate Crime Statistics dataset](https://crime-data-explorer.fr.cloud.gov/pages/downloads#nibrs-downloads) provides annual statistics on the number of incidents, offenses, victims, and offenders in reported crimes that are motivated in whole, or in part, by an offender’s bias against the victim’s perceived race, gender, gender identity, religion, disability, sexual orientation, or ethnicity. Hate Crime data are captured by indicating the element of bias present in offenses already being reported to the UCR Program.

Data is collected separately for victims identifying as Asian Alone _and_ Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander. Separate datasets for each group are provided, in addition to an aggregated dataset representing statistics for the Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) group.
